feeling\nthat conveys a dynamic and varied rhythm. This gives a pleasant feeling to\nreaders of long texts.\n\nThe family follows humanist proportions and principles, just like the serif\nversion of the family, Alegreya. It achieves a ludic and harmonious\nparagraph through elements carefully designed in an atmosphere of\ndiversity.\n\nThe italics bring a strong emphasis to the roman styles, and each have\nseven weights to bring you a wide typographic palette.","links":["https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Alegreya+Sans","https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day/fonts/alegreya-sans"],"normal":4,"bold":7},"screen":{"$formality":0.4545454545454546,"$type":["serif","old-style"],"$weight":2,"$width":2,"$xheight":2,"$contrast":2,"$caps":"normal","family":"Alegreya","name":"Alegreya","foundry":"google","license":"ofl","similar_to":["Lapture","Schneidler"],"description":"Alegreya was chosen as one of 53 \"Fonts of the Decade\" at the ATypI Letter2\ncompetition in September 2011, and one of the top 14 text type systems.
